# MS-BPAInfo
Microsoft Best Practice Analyzer Collector, or however i am supposed to word it / call it.
This program was an idea from a colleague at work during 2021/2022, which would be be very usefull, as they deal Microsoft Server almost every day.

This program Scan and Collects or just collects Best Practice analyzes from Microsoft Best Practice Analyzer (or just BPA for short) thats built-in Windows Servers 2016 and newer.
With this they can scan and collect BPA inforation from their server with the help of a CSV list or servername, and have the results centrally collected from the place you ran it from. 
It supports IP or Hostname, allows you to collect results or scan and collect results, it will only scan based on what features are installed (i wouldn't say its 100% accurate yet, i haven't tested this on a large scale, but it should give usefull information 90% of the times)

Note: this is one of the first larger scale programs that i have made with PowerShell, some mistakes/possiblities for improvement here and there are to be expected.
Time spent making: â‰ˆ 25 hours.
